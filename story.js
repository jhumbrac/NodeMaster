    There are no markings or signs to direct you. You begin to feel cold, and you could swear you hear the faint sound of footsteps coming 
    from one of the passages before you.`

    but you cannot. You need to stop drinking. You continue, and find a club on the ground. "This will be good for hitting," you think. You come to 
    another door at a dead end. You reach for the handle but hear noise on the other side. Faint rattling.`

    content: `The body of your foe lies before you. Bloodied and bruised, you look down and see a small satchel. You open it to reveal a small scroll. The scroll reads as follows: "You are in grave danger. 
    Do not be quick to trust anything. Also, I would appreciate it if you could kill the nobleman who lives in the top tower of the castle you're in."
    "....Sounds fair", you think to yourself. 
    You pocket the scroll, and open the door before you.
    In the next room you see a staircase leading upwards. You hear the sounds of laughter and shouting from above you. You appear to be in the kitchen of a Greathall. A cook spots you.

    choices: [`>Run up the stairs`, `>Fight the Cook`],

    The Greathall is filled with drunkards and veterans. Telling tales of battles won and lost, and adventures beyond imagining. You chuckle and hand out pasties. The patrons offer you drinks.`,

    You excuse yourself to use the restroom. Once finished, you're accosted by one of the drinking men. "Did you wash your hands in there?"`,

    "What's a lowly cook doing up here with real men? We don't fight with baguettes!" he laughs. He is a military man. So you're sure he isn't intelligent.`,

    You push open the door and find yourself in a grand foyer. It's decorated in gold and ivory and rubies.... and blood.... and fire..... Apparently this keep you're in has seen better days.
    "HELP! HELP PLEASE!" Servants and innocents alike scream in unison. A ${monster} is not following party ettiquette very well. Must've come out of that portal too.`,

    of the tower, and kill the Nobleman like the tiny scroll told you to. You stumble up a seemingly endless amount of stairs. You run out of breath. "Damn nobles and their ivory towers."
    You reach a chamber at the top of the tower and kick in the door. A frail old man waits inside. "Are you the noble?" you ask. "Yes. Who are you?" he retorts. "I don't know." you reply.`,

    "By whom?!" he retorts. You think for a moment, and consider your actions up to this point. You open your mouth to speak, and then think some more. You have no real answer.
    "BY WHOM?!" he asks again. ".......yes" is your only response. The Nobleman rolls his eyes. You stab him until he stops being judgmental.
    You drop your sword. Exhausted. You wander back down to the Greathall, castle still aflame from the portal mischief. You sit at the Greathall table,
    watching people scramble to contain the havoc while you down the remnants of unfinished drinks. Seemingly hours go by, and in a daze you manage to stagger out of the castle and into a grassy clearing.
    You lie down and murmer to yourself about sorting all of this nonsense out in the morning. You can no longer keep your eyes open and you drift off to sleep...
    
    You wake up on a hard stone floor.`
